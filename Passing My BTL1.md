# Passing My Blue Team Level 1

## Shae Haseldine

BTL1 Certified | Student at CyberLynk

June 13, 2025

So, one of the things my mentors at  [CyberLynk](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cyberlynks-pty-ltd/)  have stressed to me is that certifications are great, but it's the hands-on skills that are important. This can make or break your entry into cybersecurity, as well as how well you perform once there. The more hands-on skills you have, the more likely you are to stand out to potential employers, and those skills can also help you thrive in an industry that seems like a bottomless pit of information. With this in mind, this certification is a real two-for-one deal.

The Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) certification by  [Security Blue Team](https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7338907489368756224/#)  has been my first official cybersecurity certification, and I'd like to share my experience completing it with anyone looking to pursue a SOC role or who is just interested in taking on the same certification. I hope you enjoy!

NOTE: Introduction and Exam Prep are more brief guides than actual domains

Security Domains Covered + Intro an Prep

Each domain has theory modules and usually one or two labs towards the end to throw you right into the action. You get access to the platform's training for four months, and the entire training takes around 30 hours to complete (depending on how you take your notes). Read more about the criteria  [here](https://support.securityblue.team/hc/en-gb/articles/11316638140444-BTL1-Exam-Format). The exam can be taken at any time during the 12 months from the purchase date, although I strongly suggest that you complete all of the labs and content before attempting the exam, especially if you are new to cybersecurity.

### Main Tools Covered:

Autopsy, Browser History Capturer, Browser History Viewer, CyberChef, DeepBlueCLI, DomainTools, Event Viewer, FTK Imager, JumpList Explorer, KAPE, Linux CLI, MISP, PECmd, PhishTool, PowerShell, ProcDump, Scalpel, Splunk, TheHive5, URL2PNG, VirusTotal, Volatility, WannaBrowser, Windows File Analyser, Wireshark and  [more](https://www.securityblue.team/certifications/blue-team-level-1)

### My Approach:

Clearly, there is a lot to cover in this course, so I made sure that I completed all of the theory, quizzes, and labs (over the course of a month) and really tried to understand what each tool was doing and why I was using it, as opposed to just following instructions blindly. The estimated time for completing each lab was helpful in understanding whether I was struggling with the lab or flying through it. This helped me flag the areas I needed to work on before the exam. I will say that I did struggle with some of the Splunk labs, because you have to have an idea in your mind of what is happening in terms of infrastructure.

I also tried to take lots of notes, as recommended by many others who have taken the course. I took extensive notes during each domain section and then created a more refined version of each domain right before the exam for quick reference. I may have overdone it a bit on the notes, as I was reading each section and then writing down what I thought was the most important information, i.e., theory questions. Needless to say, I ended up with a lot of notes! However, the last section (Exam Prep) revealed that the exam was 100% practical and 0% theoryâ€”a significant detail to overlook!

### The Exam:

I started the exam around 11 a.m. and entered what I will call 'The Lab,' leaving only periodically to retrieve the essentials (food, water, and coffee). However, there was a slight hiccup right from the start for me; it turns out I may not have completely understood the question. This consumed a few precious hours of going around in circles and a lot of mental energy. It was very frustrating trying to put all of the course learning into practice and then not knowing why what I was doing kept failing. Keep in mind that during this process, your attention and critical thinking slowly decline as you are locked in for possibly 12 hours straight. So, for this to happen on the first question was not good.

After some time spent trying to solve this problem, I moved on to the next question (as they can be completed in any order), thinking that maybe once I solved some of the others, the answer to the initial question would become clearer. I pushed through, and as I answered more questions, things began to make more sense. A few hours later, my clipboard stopped working for reasons unknown, which I tried to fix, but was unsuccessful. This didn't stop me in my tracks, it just slowed the process down. Frustration started to build, and the pressure of a timeline in the back of my mind began to grow. I took a break to drink some water and clear my mind. I then returned to The Lab to look at things with a fresh set of eyes. Finally, I finished the exam around 2 a.m., and to my disappointment... I actually failed by a single question!

After critically reviewing the feedback to see where I went wrong, I noticed that many of the suggestions made were actually the same processes I used to get the answers I did. This made me think that maybe I had just made a slight mistake in my process or a typo when inputting my answers (seeing as my clipboard had abandoned me). So, I opted for a review, which would take about five working days. After a few days of uncertainty and disappointment, I received an email saying my grade had been reviewed, and to my delight... I received a passing grade!

It was a sort of bittersweet moment, but after looking back at the feedback, it was clear that I was on the right track with it all. I just fell into some of the common pitfalls that one encounters when using certain tools, which is a valuable learning experience, as this can have significant consequences in the real world. So, aside from some technicalities, I am now more confident in using these tools, and more importantly, I have learnt from my mistakes.

### My Exam Tips:

-   A big tip is that you should always check what is in the actual exam first and then reverse engineer what you'll need for it. This way, you will know exactly when to take notes.

-   Understand how to analyse things manually and don't rely on tools that automate the process. For example, if you know how to manually retrieve all the artefacts from a phishing email, then you will not be held back when you don't have the luxury of automating the process with something like PhishTool.

-   Know how to use the tools you have learnt until you can easily complete the labs. Once the labs become easy, you have enough skill for the exam.
-   During preparation, make sure you note down the areas you are struggling with as you go through the material; that way, you can return to them and improve before starting the exam.

-   Make sure you understand the question. This can reduce the amount of time you spend looking for information that may not be applicable.

-   If you tried your hardest and failed, but think you may have gotten an answer or two correct, ask for a review.

-   Lastly, take your time and have fun! If you can keep the enjoyment up, the curiosity and willingness to learn will follow.

This experience has shown me just how important having hands-on skills is, because this is what it will come down to when you are a SOC analyst.

Thank you to my mentors at  [CyberLynk](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cyberlynks-pty-ltd/)  for the unparalleled support on this journey and to  [Security Blue Team](https://www.linkedin.com/company/security-blue-team/)  for the great hands-on certification which, although was frustrating at times, was still very enjoyable. I'll be sure to keep making use of the  [BTLO platform](https://blueteamlabs.online/)  for more experience (which I am also really loving, by the way).

Keep up the grind, and if you have enough passion, you're going to enjoy the journey. This is where you will thrive when others deviate. The hard times are where you grow!
